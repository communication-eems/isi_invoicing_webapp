Signal handlers for the financial app.

1. Invoice / Payment sync
   ──────────────────────
   Keep Invoice.amount_paid / amount_remaining / status in sync whenever a
   Payment record is created, modified, or deleted.

   * Payment.save() and Payment.delete() already call invoice.refresh_payment_totals()
     directly. The post_save / post_delete signals below add a second sync layer
     that fires on bulk ORM updates (Payment.objects.filter(...).update(...)),
     which do NOT trigger model.save().

   * InvoiceItem signals are intentionally NOT present here because:
     - InvoiceItem.save() / delete() already call invoice.recalculate_amounts()
       and raise ValidationError when the invoice is locked.
     - Adding signals on top would cause a double-recalculation on every item save.

   * Phase guard: payment signals only recalculate when the invoice is in the
     FINALE phase. Proforma invoices have no payments; the guard is a safety net.

2. Beneficiary ↔ Trainer two-way sync
   ────────────────────────────────────
   Trainer.save() already pushes data to Beneficiary (formations_models.py).
   The signal below handles the reverse direction: whenever a Beneficiary of
   type "formateur" is saved without a linked Trainer, a Trainer record is
   auto-created and the two are linked.

   Sync-loop prevention
   ────────────────────
   * When THIS signal creates a Trainer it sets  trainer._skip_beneficiary_sync = True
     so that Trainer.save() does NOT turn around and call update_or_create on the
     Beneficiary again (which would cause an infinite loop and a duplicate row).

   * When Trainer.save() re-saves an existing Beneficiary after adopting it, it sets
     beneficiary._skip_trainer_sync = True so THIS signal skips that save.

   * Only the creation path (and explicit type change to "formateur") triggers
     Trainer auto-creation.  Subsequent field-level edits on either side are NOT
     mirrored automatically; save the Trainer to propagate its changes to the
     Beneficiary (the original direction already works).
