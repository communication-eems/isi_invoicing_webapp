#   source venv/bin/activate
#   ./reseed_all.sh
#
# Invoice numbering (proforma_reference) is generated from a shared,
# per-year sequence. The sequel scripts force that sequence to specific
# historical numbers, so any leftover invoices from a previous partial
# run WILL collide. We therefore always flush invoices/sequences first —
# clients and formations are left untouched (get_or_create, safe to reuse).
